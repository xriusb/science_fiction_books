                <p>This allegory about humanity’s exploration of the universe—and the universe’s reaction to humanity—is
                    a hallmark achievement in storytelling that follows the crew of the spacecraft Discovery as they
                    embark on a mission to Saturn. Their vessel is controlled by HAL 9000, an artificially intelligent
                    supercomputer capable of the highest level of cognitive functioning that rivals—and perhaps
                    threatens—the human mind.</p>

                <p>The four Ware novels (Software, Wetware, Freeware, and Realware) explore consciousness as an
                    information pattern in a fearlessly absurd, awesomely readable way. All together, they’re a Dadaist
                    cyberpunk tour de force that’ll make your brain feel like it’s in a bath of seltzer water. The books
                    all move like a bat out of hell, are packed with enough ideas for forty normal science fictions
                    books, and you can feel beat poetry in the background as you read them.</p>

                <p>Excession is the fifth book in Banks’s excellent Culture series.
                    Two and a half millennia ago, the artifact appeared in a remote corner of space, beside a
                    trillion-year-old dying sun from a different universe. It was a perfect black-body sphere, and it
                    did nothing. Then it disappeared.
                    Now it is back.</p>

        <p>Criticized for its violence (and possibly popular because of it), Ender’s Game shows children on a military
          space station, training for the war against the evil alien Buggers.
          It won the Hugo and Nebula awards, even though the New York Times felt that the plot resembled a “grade Z,
          made-for-television, science-fiction rip-off movie.”</p>

      <h3>Childhood’s End, by Arthur C. Clarke (1953)</h3>

        <p>It looks like a good deal at first: a peaceful alien invasion by the mysterious Overlords, whose arrival ends
          all war, helps form a world government, and turns the planet into a near-utopia. However, they refuse to
          answer questions about themselves and govern from orbiting spaceships.

          Clarke has said that the idea for Childhood’s End may have come from the numerous blimps floating over London
          during World War II.</p>

      <h3>The War of the Worlds, by H. G. Wells (1898)</h3>

        <p>The granddaddy of alien invasion stories, The War of the Worlds was classified as “scientific romance,” as
          was Wells’s earlier book, The Time Machine.
          Wells appears to have enjoyed the idea of obliterating his neighborhood. In a letter to a friend, he wrote,
          “I’m doing the dearest little serial for Pearson’s new magazine, in which I completely wreck and sack Woking —
          killing my neighbors in painful and eccentric ways — then proceed via Kingston and Richmond to London, which I
          sack, selecting South Kensington for feats of peculiar atrocity.”</p>

        <p>The United States government is given a warning by the pre-eminent biophysicists in the country: current

          Two years later, seventeen satellites are sent into the outer fringes of space to collect organisms and dust
          for study. One of them falls ...more</p>

      <h3>The Mote in God’s Eye, by Larry Niven and Jerry Pournelle (1974)</h3>

        <p>In the year 3016, the Second Empire of Man spans hundreds of star systems, thanks to the faster-than-light
          Alderson Drive. No other intelligent beings have ever been encountered, not until a light sail probe enters a
          human system carrying a dead alien. The probe is traced to the Mote, an isolated star in a thick dust cloud,
          and an expedition is dispatched.

          Robert A. Heinlein, who gave the authors extensive advice on the novel, described the story as “possibly the
          finest science fiction novel I have ever read.”</p>

      <h3>The Day of the Triffids, by John Wyndham (1951)</h3>
      <div class="flexContainer">

        </figure>
        <p>The Day Of The Triffids is a classic, one of the cornerstones of the post-apocalyptic genre. It traces the
          fate of the world after a comet shower blinds most of the world’s population. The few with sight must struggle
          to reconstruct society while fighting mobile, flesh-eating plants called triffids.
          Arthur C. Clarke called The Day Of The Triffids an “immortal story.” Director Danny Boyle says the opening
          hospital sequence of The Day of the Triffids inspired Alex Garland to write the screenplay for 28 Days Later.

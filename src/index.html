      <p><strong>Science fiction</strong> (abbreviated SF or sci-fi with varying punctuation and capitalization) is a
        broad genre of fiction that often involves speculations based on current or future science or technology.
        Science fiction is found in books, art, television, films, games, theatre, and other media. In organizational
        or
        marketing contexts, science fiction can be synonymous with the broader definition of speculative fiction,
        encompassing creative works incorporating imaginative elements not found in contemporary reality; this
        includes
        fantasy, horror and related genres.</p>
      <p>Although the two genres are often conflated as science fiction/fantasy, science fiction differs from fantasy
        in
        that, within the context of the story, its imaginary elements are largely possible within scientifically
        established or scientifically postulated laws of nature (though some elements in a story might still be pure
        imaginative speculation). Exploring the consequences of such differences is the traditional purpose of science
        fiction, making it a "literature of ideas". Science fantasy is largely based on writing entertainingly and
        rationally about alternate possibilities in settings that are contrary to known reality.</p>

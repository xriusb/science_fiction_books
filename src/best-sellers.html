        <h3>Foundation, by Isaac Asimov (1951)</h3>

        <p>Asimov was a prolific writer, but many of his best works are classic short stories such as Nightfall, or The
          Last Question, which play out like long jokes with a punchline twist at the end. In the Foundation series,
          he’s
          in another mode entirely, charting the rise and fall of empires in sweeping brush strokes. Asimov’s prose can
          be
          stilted, and betrays the attitudes of its time in the portrayal of female characters, but it has left a
          lasting
          legacy.</p>

        <p>This landmark novel begins with a simple proposition – what if humans could teleport? – and sprawls into a
          tale
          of rebirth and vengeance that winds across the Solar System: The Count of Monte Cristo for the interstellar
          age.
          First published as Tiger! Tiger! in the UK, named after the William Blake poem, it follows Gully Foyle – a
          violent, uneducated brute who spends six months marooned in deep space, and the rest of the book seeking
          retribution for it.</p>

        <p>One of Elon Musk's favourite books, apparently, this gripping novel paints a plausible picture of life on
          Earth's satellite, three years before man set foot on the moon for the first time. Its depictions of the
          challenges of life in orbit, and the ingenuity of human solutions to the problem – even among the exiles and
          misfits who make up the lunar population – are memorable.</p>

        <p>A curious novel that reads less like sci-fi and more like a hallucinated autobiography detailing the author’s
          struggle with drug addiction. In a near-future California, vice cop Bob Arctor lives undercover with a
          community of drug addicts hooked on devastating psychoactive dope Substance D. Arctor, who needs to don a
          special “scramble suit” to hide his face and voice when meeting his fellow cops, has to grapple with gradually
          losing his sense of self.</p>

      <h3>The Left Hand of Darkness, by Ursula K. Le Guin (1969)</h3>

        <p>Le Guin alternated between genres during her prolific career, and this intricate novel came out the year
          after the classic fantasy book A Wizard of Earthsea. The bulk of the action takes place on Winter, a remote
          Earth-like planet where it’s cold all year round, and everyone is the same gender. It was one of the first
          novels to touch on ideas of androgyny – which is viewed from the lens of protagonist Genly Ai, a visitor from
          Earth who struggles to understand this alien culture.</p>

      <h3>Neuromancer, by William Gibson (1984)</h3>

          <img src="img/neuromancer.jpg">
        </figure>
        <p>The definitive cyberpunk novel, William Gibson’s Neuromancer follows hacker-turned-junkie Henry Case as he
          tries to pull off one last, rather dodgy sounding job in the hope of reversing a toxin that prevents him from
          accessing cyberspace. Set in a dystopian Japanese underworld, the novel touches on all manner of futuristic
          technology, from AI to cryonics, and features a cast of creative characters that will stick with you long
          after you turn the last page.</p>

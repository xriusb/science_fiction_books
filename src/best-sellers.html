      <h3>Foundation, by Isaac Asimov (1951)</h3>

        <p>Asimov was a prolific writer, but many of his best works are classic short stories such as Nightfall, or The
          Last Question, which play out like long jokes with a punchline twist at the end. In the Foundation series,
          he’s
          in another mode entirely, charting the rise and fall of empires in sweeping brush strokes. Asimov’s prose can
          be
          stilted, and betrays the attitudes of its time in the portrayal of female characters, but it has left a
          lasting
          legacy.</p>

        <p>This landmark novel begins with a simple proposition – what if humans could teleport? – and sprawls into a
          tale
          of rebirth and vengeance that winds across the Solar System: The Count of Monte Cristo for the interstellar
          age.
          First published as Tiger! Tiger! in the UK, named after the William Blake poem, it follows Gully Foyle – a
          violent, uneducated brute who spends six months marooned in deep space, and the rest of the book seeking
          retribution for it.</p>

        <p>One of Elon Musk's favourite books, apparently, this gripping novel paints a plausible picture of life on
          Earth's satellite, three years before man set foot on the moon for the first time. Its depictions of the
          challenges of life in orbit, and the ingenuity of human solutions to the problem – even among the exiles and
          misfits who make up the lunar population – are memorable.</p>

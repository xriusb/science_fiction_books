                <p>The Foundation series is a science fiction book series written by American author Isaac Asimov. First
                    published as a series of short stories in 1942–50, and subsequently in three collections in 1951–53,
                    for thirty years the series was a trilogy: Foundation, Foundation and Empire, and Second Foundation.
                    It won the one-time Hugo Award for "Best All-Time Series" in 1966.Asimov began adding new
                    volumes in 1981, with two sequels: Foundation's Edge and Foundation and Earth, and two prequels:
                    Prelude to Foundation and Forward the Foundation. The additions made reference to events in Asimov's
                    Robot and Empire series, indicating that they were also set in the same fictional universe.</p>
                <p>The premise of the stories is that, in the waning days of a future Galactic Empire, the mathematician
                    Hari Seldon spends his life developing a theory of psychohistory, a new and effective mathematical
                    sociology. Using statistical laws of mass action, it can predict the future of large populations.
                    Seldon foresees the imminent fall of the Empire, which encompasses the entire Milky Way, and a dark
                    age lasting 30,000 years before a second empire arises. Although the inertia of the Empire's fall is
                    too great to stop, Seldon devises a plan by which "the onrushing mass of events must be deflected
                    just a little" to eventually limit this interregnum to just one thousand years. To implement his
                    plan, Seldon creates the Foundations—two groups of scientists and engineers settled at opposite ends
                    of the galaxy—to preserve the spirit of science and civilization, and thus become the cornerstones
                    of the new galactic empire.</p>
                <p>A key feature of Seldon's theory, which has proved influential in real-world social science, is an
                    uncertainty or incompleteness principle: if a population gains knowledge of its predicted behavior,
                    its self-aware collective actions become unpredictable.</p>

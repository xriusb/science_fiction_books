                <p>In order to develop a secure defense against a hostile alien race's next attack, government agencies
                    breed child geniuses and train them as soldiers. A brilliant young boy, Andrew "Ender" Wiggin lives
                    with his kind but distant parents, his sadistic brother Peter, and the person he loves more than
                    anyone else, his sister Valentine. Peter and Valentine were candidates for the soldier-training
                    program but didn't make the cut—young Ender is the Wiggin drafted to the orbiting Battle School for
                    rigorous military training.</p>
                <p>Ender's skills make him a leader in school and respected in the Battle Room, where children play at
                    mock battles in zero gravity. Yet growing up in an artificial community of young soldiers Ender
                    suffers greatly from isolation, rivalry from his peers, pressure from the adult teachers, and an
                    unsettling fear of the alien invaders. His psychological battles include loneliness, fear that he is
                    becoming like the cruel brother he remembers, and fanning the flames of devotion to his beloved
                    sister.</p>
                <p>Is Ender the general Earth needs? But Ender is not the only result of the genetic experiments. The
                    war with the Buggers has been raging for a hundred years, and the quest for the perfect general has
                    been underway for almost as long. Ender's two older siblings are every bit as unusual as he is, but
                    in very different ways. Between the three of them lie the abilities to remake a world. If, that is,
                    the world survives.</p>

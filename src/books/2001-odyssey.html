                <p>A breakthrough into the twenty-first century, this novel and movie puts the man of today into the
                    credible environment of tomorrow, when he has conquered the perils of interplanetary travel and is
                    ready for what comes next.
                    You are hurtling across the abyss of space on an expedition to unexplored planets. Your only
                    companion is a fellow astronaut: The three hibernauts who lie in a deep-freeze sleep will not be
                    awakened until their skills are needed.</p>
                <p>An essential member of your crew is Hal, the electronic, almost-human brain that ceaselessly guides
                    your course. For months your atom-powered craft Discovery has been carrying you away from earth at a
                    hundred thousand miles an hour. You are now farther from home than any man in history.
                    Your living quarters within the 400-foot-long spacecraft is a centrifugal drum equipped with an
                    electronic library of literature and music. Here you relax, eat, exercise, sleep, and chat with Hal,
                    the conversational computer who never forgets anything-not even your birthday.</p>
                <p>Your mission is of such importance that it has been surrounded by the deepest official secrecy. You
                    are probing a fantastic frontier, following a trail that has led to the outer edges of the Solar
                    System. You are searching the stars for evidence that man is not alone.
                    On the Earth colonized Moon, deep in the crater Tycho, a discovery has been made that has shattered
                    the human concept of the universe. You are journeying towards something. You do not know what it is.
                    You only know it has been waiting for man to find it for four million years.</p>
                <p>Arthur C. Clarke, Fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society and a writer of science fiction, has
                    produced this work that compares to the prophetic novels of Jules Verne. Author of the novel and
                    co-author with Stanley Kubrick of the screen play for Kubrick's motion picture production, Clarke
                    creates the cosmic desolations and splendors that man will someday see as he travels gigamiles into
                    time and space.</p>
